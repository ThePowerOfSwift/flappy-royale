## Attire

There are two types of attire: bases and hats

You have to have a base, but can have up to three hats.

### Acquiring them

- Unique Daily bodies which are hard to get from Royale mode
- Random hats which can be earned by playing the game (also maybe achievement (number of flaps, pipes, time etc))
