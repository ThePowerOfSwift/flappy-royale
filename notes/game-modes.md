Aim is to support multiple game modes.

## Flappy Royale

There is a daily level where you play a random selection of people who have played that seed before. Ideally, we keep
track of the min/max/avg score for someone and try use that to provide challenging but fair-ish opportunities to win.

Top 5 winning gets you a set of special coins, these are used to buy attire. If you get past over 20 pipes, you get the
chance to trade for the daily attire Flappy Royale.

We think there might be a need to have an Ais to against when the seed has less than 100 opponents.

## Trial Royale

Daily we offer ~10 levels for you to choose from, and you get to compete to be the highest for that day - the opposing
players are visually different from flappy royale mode somehow.s

## Training

No ghosts, just the plain old game. Fast restarts etc.
