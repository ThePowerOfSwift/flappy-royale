Aim is to support multiple game modes:

## Flappy Royale

There are a set of knowns level where you play a random selection of people who have played that seed before.

## Trial Royale

There is a constant seed for a particular time period. You play against the best-ofs for that seed. You get x amount of
lives, e.g. only 10 per day. When you run out of time then you can watch a modal ad to get another x lives.
