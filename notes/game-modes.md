Aim is to support multiple game modes.

## Flappy Royale

There is a daily level where you play a random selection of people who have played that seed before. Ideally, we 
keep track of the min/max/avg score for someone and try use that to provide challenging but fair-ish
opportunities to win.

We think there might be a need to have an Ais to against when the seed has less than 100 opponents.

## Trial Royale

Daily we offer ~10 levels, and you get to compete to be the highest for that day - the opposing players are visually
different from flappy royale mode somehow. 

## Training

No ghosts, just the plain old game. Fast restarts etc.
