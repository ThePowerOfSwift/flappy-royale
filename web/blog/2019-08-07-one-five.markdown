## One Point Five!

#### Orta & Em - Aug 12th

Heyo everyone!

We're happy to be shipping Flappy Royale 1.5 - currently in App Store review. It's got two major changes, one you'll
love and another which should make life a bit easier.

## Night Mode

We have been beefing up the ability to create game themes, and to experiment with that we've created a day & night mode
for the flappers to play in. You can switch between day or night in the settings, or have it automatically change
according to what your current time is.

## Bye-bye Banner

We ran the maths on the bottom banner which we've been showing in-game, and opted to pull the banner completely. This
change doesn't move the ad anywhere else, or increase the frequency of ads elsewhere. Our policy has been to only show
an ad if there's something worthwhile on the other side. That's still the same: getting extra lives for trial and
unlocking eggs.
